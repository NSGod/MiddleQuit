Quit apps by middle clicking Dock items.

## Info
The app lives in the top bar, from where you can enable launch at login, open the accessibility settings (more on that below), or quit the app.

If the stock icon in the top bar bothers you, let me know and I'll bother to make an icon for it. I'm working under the assumption that nobody will care or even download this.

## Installation
When you first open the app, it will ask you to enable Accessibility permissions. This is standard for apps like these, so they can interfere with regular input processes. After enabling, quit and restart the app.

If you choose to download and run the pre-built app, when initially opening it, you will need to manually allow it to run (Apple could not verify “MiddleQuit.app” is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.) by going to System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Scroll down to 'Security' and allow it there. 

I'm not completely familiar with sharing macOS apps, so if you have any issues installing, open an issue and hopefully we can work through it together. 

##
**Tested on macOS Tahoe 26.1**, (M4 MacBook air + a third-party app which enables middle click on the touchpad)

(let me know your system and if it works on it, I can add to this list)

## Don't trust me?
I don't blame you! I'm just a random guy on the internet who vibe coded a Mac app. If you prefer, build the app yourself in Xcode after ensuring there is no pesky code inside. 😄
